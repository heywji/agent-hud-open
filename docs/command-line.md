# Command line

## Overview

Launch options, read-only probes and adapter commands of the standalone application. The same switches work on `build/Agent HUD Open.app/Contents/MacOS/Agent HUD Open` (after `make build`), on `swift run AgentHUDOpen`, and through Launch Services as `open "build/Agent HUD Open.app" --args …`. Unknown switches are ignored; probes and adapter commands run before the application object exists and never show a window. Applications that embed the libraries document their own parameters.

## Launch and display

| Switch | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--demo` | Use the design's sample data (`DemoUsageProvider`, `DemoData.agents`) instead of installed clients. Preferences live in the separate `app.agenthud.open.demo` defaults domain, no report cache is written, and no adapters are installed. |
| `--lang zh\|en\|system` | Force the interface language for this launch (`zh`, `zh-hans` and `cn` select Simplified Chinese). The choice is saved to the preferences in use. |
| `--show-settings` | Open the settings window after start. |
| `--show-stats` | Open the statistics window after start. |
| `--open-panel` | Start with the notch panel expanded. |
| `--show-onboarding` | Show the first-launch window even when onboarding is complete. |
| `--reset-defaults` | Remove the application's stored preferences before starting. |
| `--snapshot <dir>` | Render every screen at 2× to PNG files in `<dir>` from sample data, then quit; only a debug build renders, and a release build says so and quits. `AGENTHUD_SNAPSHOT_PREFIX=<name>` limits rendering to snapshots whose name starts with the prefix, for example `settings-`. |

`make demo` runs `--demo --show-settings`; `make snapshot` runs `--snapshot build/snapshots` (override the directory with `SNAPSHOT_DIR=…`).

Only one Agent HUD runs at a time, whichever application built on these libraries it is. A launch while another copy runs shows an alert naming the application that runs and quits before it reads preferences, opens the ledger or touches a client's settings. The lock is `~/Library/Caches/app.agenthud/instance.lock`, released by the system when its holder quits or crashes; a lock that cannot be created lets the launch run. Snapshots, probes and adapter commands run beside the running copy, and so does `--demo`; a launch with `--reset-defaults` does not, since the preferences it removes may be in use.

## Read-only probes

| Command | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `--probe` | Prints where Claude Code's engine, Codex's engine and home, DeepSeek Harness's home and Node.js are, the agents in the settings and one step of reading Claude Code's transcripts; then one real account refresh (48 h of history) and one report with how long each took, `Quota windows: n; sessions: n; live: n; billing accounts: n`, the plans and notice, the discovered rows, each window's share used and reset, sessions by client, DeepSeek Harness's sessions and tokens, each balance and its estimated cost, the five newest sessions with their tokens and the values the vendor catalog does not name. Exits 0, or prints the error and exits 1. It issues the same provider requests as the running application and nothing else, and keeps what it reads in memory: it writes nothing to the usage ledger, removes or imports no earlier version's files and remembers no account identity. No conversation text and no credential is printed. |
| `--probe-open-agents` | Indexes the last seven days of local OpenCode, Kimi and Pi sessions and prints, per client, the session count, running count, distinct usage events, In / Out / Cache totals and the read status. No network requests, no transcript text, no credentials in the output. |
| `AGENT_HUD_PROBE_ADDITIONAL=1 swift test --filter AdditionalProviderTests/testInstalledSourcesReadOnlyProbe` | Read-only probe of the installed Antigravity, Cursor and Grok sources from the test suite; the test is skipped unless the variable is set. |
| `AGENT_HUD_PROBE_GROK=1 swift test --filter AdditionalProviderTests/testInstalledGrokLocalUsageReadOnlyProbe` | Local Grok token totals after merging inference and completed-turn logs, alongside turn-log totals. No network requests or conversation text; skipped unless enabled. |

## Adapter commands

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--install-pi-observer` | Write or update the Agent HUD extension `extensions/agent-hud.ts` under the Pi directory (`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, default `~/.pi/agent`), then exit. Existing Pi sessions need `/reload` once. A same-named file that is not Agent HUD's is left alone and the command fails. |
| `--attention-hook claude` | The handler Claude Code invokes for a notification: reads the payload from standard input, records the session's pending request, prints `{}` and exits 0 even when recording fails. |
| `--permission-hook claude\|codex\|qoder\|qoderCN\|qoderWork\|codebuddy\|workbuddy\|zcode\|qwen` | The handler the client invokes when it is about to ask whether a tool may run: forwards the payload to the running application and waits, prints back the decision the user gave, and exits 0. Codex CLI and Desktop share the `codex` handler. Prints nothing — leaving the client's own permission flow untouched — when the application is not running, the payload cannot be read, nobody answers before the client stops waiting, or Claude Code's session record shows the call was answered in Claude Code itself. It never initializes the interface or queries an account. |
| `--install-completion-hook antigravity\|cursor\|copilot\|codebuddy\|qwen` | Point the client's stop hook at this executable, adding it when it is missing; an Agent HUD handler already there, whichever copy wrote it, is taken over. Other hooks in the client's configuration are preserved. Fails, changing nothing, when this executable runs from a disk image or a translocated copy. |
| `--completion-hook antigravity\|cursor\|copilot\|codebuddy\|qwen` | The handler the clients invoke: reads the hook payload from standard input, stores a completion record when the payload describes a successful stop, prints `{"decision":"stop"}` for Antigravity or `{}` for the others, and exits 0 even when recording fails. It never initializes the interface or queries an account. |

Normal start-up already runs `SessionObservers.configure(executable:enabled:)` for installed clients with the `clientHooks` setting — pointing every Agent HUD handler at this executable when it is on, whichever copy wrote it, and removing them all when it is off — which also installs Claude Code's notification hook and each supported client's approval hook ([approvals](hud.md#approvals)). Moving the application, or starting another build of it, therefore moves the hooks at the next start. Codex requires the user to review and trust a new or changed hook through `/hooks` before it runs; the HUD does not change hook trust or enable disabled hooks. The install commands exist for a first setup without launching the application ([notification hook](session-lifecycle.md#notification-hook), [completion hooks](session-lifecycle.md#completion-hooks)).

## Environment

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `SWIFT_SCRATCH_PATH` | Passed to `swift build` as `--scratch-path` by the build script |
| `AGENTHUD_SNAPSHOT_PREFIX` | Limits `--snapshot` to snapshots whose name starts with the prefix |
| `AGENT_HUD_PROBE_ADDITIONAL` | Enables the read-only probe test above |
| Client home overrides and provider keys (`CODEX_HOME`, `DSH_HOME`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, …) | Read from the process environment ([providers](providers.md)); a directory variable that is empty or only whitespace counts as unset. An application started from Finder or Launch Services inherits the login session's environment, not the exports of a terminal shell. |
